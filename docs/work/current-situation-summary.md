# AI Personal Assistant - Current Situation Summary

**Date**: August 28, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **FULLY DEPLOYED AND WORKING** - Both frontend and backend operational  
**Last Updated**: Current session

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

This is an AI-powered personal assistant project with a React/TypeScript frontend and Python/FastAPI backend. The project includes features for sprint management, project tracking, ritual tracking, family reminders, and MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration.

## 🏗️ **Architecture & Technology Stack**

### **Frontend**
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Bundler**: Vite
- **Deployment**: Netlify ✅ **LIVE and Working**
- **URL**: https://mikes-personal-assistant.netlify.app

### **Backend**
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy with Alembic migrations
- **Deployment**: Render ✅ **LIVE and Working**
- **URL**: https://ai-personal-assistant-9xpq.onrender.com
- **Status**: ✅ **LIVE and Working**

### **Key Features Implemented**
- Sprint Manager (start, nudge, complete sprints)
- Project Dashboard (CRUD operations)
- Ritual Tracker (morning/evening rituals)
- Family Reminders (daily tasks, contact management)
- MCP Integration (stubbed out, ready for implementation)

## ✅ **Issues Successfully Resolved**

### 1. **Backend CORS Configuration** - RESOLVED ✅
- **Problem**: Backend was blocking requests from Netlify frontend due to CORS policy
- **Solution**: Updated `backend/main.py` CORS configuration to allow requests from:
  - `https://mikes-personal-assistant.netlify.app`
  - `https://ai-personal-assistant-9xpq.onrender.com`
- **Status**: Deployed and working on Render

### 2. **Backend Deployment** - RESOLVED ✅
- **Problem**: Initial Render deployment failed due to Rust compilation issues with pydantic
- **Solution**: Updated `backend/requirements.txt` to use `pydantic>=2.10.0` (pre-compiled wheels)
- **Status**: Successfully deployed and responding to API requests

### 3. **Frontend-Backend Communication** - RESOLVED ✅
- **Problem**: Frontend was hardcoded to use `localhost:8000` for API calls
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `frontend/src/utils/api.ts` utility for environment-aware API URLs
  - Updated all components to use `apiUrl()` helper function
  - Configured environment variables in Netlify for production
- **Status**: Frontend properly configured for production with environment variables

### 4. **Dependency Conflicts** - RESOLVED ✅
- **Problem**: Python package version conflicts during installation
- **Solution**: Updated `backend/requirements.txt` with flexible version ranges
- **Status**: All dependencies install successfully

### 5. **Netlify Frontend Deployment** - RESOLVED ✅
- **Problem**: Netlify was not serving static files due to incorrect build configuration
- **Root Cause**: `netlify.toml` had incorrect build command and publish path
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed build command from `cd frontend && npm install && npm run build` to `npm install && npm run build`
  - Fixed publish path from `frontend/dist` to `dist`
  - Set environment variable `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in Netlify
- **Status**: Frontend fully accessible and communicating with backend

### 6. **Local Database Persistence** - RESOLVED ✅
- **Problem**: Local version of the app was not maintaining persistent data between sessions
- **Root Cause**: Database path configuration was incorrect when running from project root
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed database path resolution in `backend/core/config.py` to work from any directory
  - Created `backend/init_local_db.py` script for easy database initialization
  - Updated `start.sh` to automatically initialize database before starting the app
- **Status**: Local app now maintains persistent data with 10 projects and 2 rituals

6. **✅ Local Data Persistence**: Local app maintains data between sessions

## 📝 **Technical Resolution Summary**

### **Netlify Configuration Fix**
The critical issue was in the `netlify.toml` configuration:
- **Before**: `command = "cd frontend && npm install && npm run build"` and `publish = "frontend/dist"`
- **After**: `command = "npm install && npm run build"` and `publish = "dist"`

The problem was that Netlify was already running the build from the `frontend` directory, so the `cd frontend` command was failing because it was trying to navigate to a directory that didn't exist from that context.

### **Environment Variable Configuration**
Successfully configured `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in Netlify admin panel, allowing the frontend to dynamically connect to the production backend without hardcoded URLs.

### **Local Database Persistence Fix**
- **Problem**: Database path was incorrect when running from project root
- **Solution**: Updated `backend/core/config.py` to dynamically resolve database path based on working directory
- **Result**: Local app now maintains persistent data with proper SQLite database
