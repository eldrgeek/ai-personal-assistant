# Assistant v0 Full Context Log

This document captures the full context from the initial Anchor Chat conversations â€” more detailed than the compact summaries. It records the evolution of Assistant v0, rituals, projects, family details, and meta-decisions.

---

## Purpose of Anchor Chat
- Serve as the **brain**: rituals, sprints, family, and overall project organization.
- Keep project-specific uploads and technical work in **separate project chats**.
- Periodically compact into summary docs to prevent overflow.

---

## Sprint Protocol (Evolution)
- Start by declaring a specific task and sprint length.
- Nudges every 15 min (max 4/hour), mid-sprint includes timestamp.
- Distractions logged with `d:` prefix or ðŸ“Œ emoji into an inbox.
- Sprint ends with retro + victory lap.
- Retro includes both user reflection and assistant feedback.
- Victory lap formalized as a ritual (stand/stretch/celebrate/mark complete).

### Sprint Ritual Steps
1. Declare sprint task.
2. Mid-sprint nudge: confirm "on" or log distraction.
3. Final nudge: retro questions â†’ *What worked? What didnâ€™t? One improvement?*
4. Victory lap (celebrate completion).

---

## Ritual Elements (Evolution)
- **Morning (~20m, extendable):**
  - Cold shower â†’ put on Limitless AI pendant.
  - Quick project/meeting review.
  - Journaling (structured: gratitude + focus + visualization/affirmation).
- **Evening (~15m, extendable):**
  - Charge all devices (incl. pendant).
  - Retro journaling (3 wins + 1 lesson + tomorrowâ€™s focus).
  - Looking ahead: pick tomorrowâ€™s focus.
- **Throughout:** After each sprint, victory lap.

## Meta-Process Decisions
- **Anchor vs Project Chats:**
  - Anchor Chat = rituals, family, overall organization.
  - Project Chats = focused work (e.g., Gregâ€™s project, MCP integration).
- **Summaries:** Compact weekly into markdown summaries for seeding new chats.
- **Canvas Use:**
  - Chat = moment-to-moment nudges and focus.
  - Canvas = grouped Q&A, drafts, and structured documents.
- **Question Style:**
  - Typically one-at-a-time questions.
  - For structure-building (like rituals), small clusters of related questions may be more efficient.
