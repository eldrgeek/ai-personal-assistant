# Anchor Chat Summary ‚Äî Essentials

This document compacts the key knowledge from the initial Anchor Chat (Assistant v0 setup).

---

## Purpose
- **Anchor Chat** = personal assistant brain for rituals, sprints, family, and meta-organization.
- **Project-specific chats** = hands-on work with documents, uploads, and code (e.g., Greg‚Äôs project, MCP integration).

---

## Sprint Protocol
- **Start:** Declare task + sprint length (e.g., `start 30 "Task"`).
- **Nudges:** Every 15 min (max 4/hour), mid-sprint includes timestamp.
- **Distractions:** Log with `d:` or üìå emoji ‚Üí added to Distraction Inbox.
- **End:** Retro + victory lap.

### Sprint Ritual Steps
1. Declare sprint task.
2. Mid-sprint nudge: confirm ‚Äúon‚Äù or log distraction.
3. Final nudge: retro questions ‚Üí *What worked? What didn‚Äôt? One improvement?*
4. Victory lap (celebrate completion).

## Ritual Elements
- **Morning (~20 min, extendable):**
  - Cold shower ‚Üí put on Limitless AI pendant.
  - Quick projects/meetings review.
  - Journaling (structured: gratitude + focus + visualization/affirmation).
- **Evening (~15 min, extendable):**
  - Charge all devices (incl. pendant).
  - Retro journaling (3 wins + 1 lesson + tomorrow‚Äôs focus).
- **After each sprint:** Victory lap.
